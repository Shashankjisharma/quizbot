quizbot
=======

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Small and simple quizbot for IRC, uses code cloned from original quizbot at https://github.com/plaimi/q/blob/master/q
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Use
===

Hack config.py. 
questions are in questions.py, as per the format. 

Start the bot with:
	$ ./q
or:
	$ python q


Dependencies
============

quizbot is written in Python and runs on the 2.7 interpreter. The dependencies 
below are listed with the oldest versions that are confirmed to work. Older 
versions *might* work. 

-python 2.7.x
-twisted >= 11.0.0
-twisted-words >= 11.0.0

A Note on Python 3
------------------

The 3.x interpreter will try to run this and fail. You *need* to use a 2.x 
interpreter (2.7.x is the only one with which quizbot is formally tested). 
This may be accomplished by specifically invoking a 2.x interpreter on some 
systems.
        $ python2 q


quizbot in #quiz_test
================================

in the #quiz_test channel on irc.devel.redhat.com:6667.  
Feel free to check it out and come play. :-)


Contributing To the Project
===========================
Yes, please. 

- Improve the way question-answer pairs are stored. (Please provide code to
  convert the current structure for me to test it.)
- Write better algorithms for detecting answers.
- Make quizbot reconnect correctly when it loses its IRC connection.
- Improve ugly parts of the code (there's plenty to choose from).
- Improve commenting by to be more clear and/or informative.
- Allow submitting questions to the bot itself
- Allow only one answer per quizzer.

Try to keep the source very short. Please take some time to come up with the
shortest readable and logical solution to what you are trying to do. 

When you are finished, send me a pull-request using Github or an email to nkshirsa@redhat.com 

Please write sane commit messages. 

No WIP-code please. 

Reporting bugs:
Bugzilla to get a new internal project for quizbot, wait for it.

Happy hacking!

To get the bot working, you might need to do all this:
pip install colorama
pip install termcolor
pip install pyfiglet
yum install python27-python-pip -y
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install twisted
yum install python2-devel
might need to change include path to get twisted to compile and find python.h
